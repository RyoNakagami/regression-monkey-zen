1. Think about structure and how we design our messages.

2. "Structure" is a narrative or storyline that connects ideas with one another. 
You have to know where you're going to start and where you're going to end.

3. Explicitly signal the structure to the reader at the beginning of the presentation, so as to help the reader easier
process the information.

4. Be conscious of the micro/macro-level structure of a text. 
The micro level refers to the structure within paragraphs, such as topic, arguments, and evidence, 
while the macro level refers to the overall structure of the text, such as introduction, methods, results, and conclusion.
